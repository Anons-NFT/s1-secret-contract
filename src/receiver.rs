/// sending multiple tokens to the same contract (a deck of game cards for instance).  ReceiveNft
/// primarily exists just to maintain CW-721 compliance.  Also, it should be noted that the CW-721
/// `sender` field is inaccurately named, because it is used to hold the address the token came from,
/// not the address that sent it (which is not always the same).  The name is reluctantly kept in
/// ReceiveNft to maintain CW-721 compliance, but BatchReceiveNft uses `sender` to hold the sending
/// address (which matches both its true role and its SNIP-20 Receive counterpart).  Any contract
/// that is implementing both Receiver Interfaces must be sure that the ReceiveNft `sender` field
/// is actually processed like a BatchReceiveNft `from` field.  Again, apologies for any confusion
/// caused by propagating inaccuracies, but because InterNFT is planning on using CW-721 standards,
/// compliance with CW-721 might be necessary
